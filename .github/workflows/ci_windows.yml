# CI Tests which run on Windows machines

# These access secrets, so should only be run on local branches.

# Ideally, the CI tests would be a single workflow, but several issues
# (especially varied OS support) mean that it is hard to keep a single
# workflow green. If there is one OS likely to lag slightly in support
# it is Windows
