# CI Tests which run on MacOS machines

# These access secrets, so should only be run on local branches.

# Ideally, the CI tests would be a single workflow, but several issues
# (especially varied OS support) mean that it is hard to keep a single
# workflow green.

# MacOS has been a particular trouble due to the small disk space
# allocations on all the VMs, leading to the --selected_model
# machinery
