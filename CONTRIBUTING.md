# Development Notes

We welcome contributions to `guidance`, and this document exists to provide useful information contributors.

## Developer Setup

The quickest way to get started is to run (in a fresh environment):
```bash
pip install -e .[all,test]
```
which should bring in all of the basic required dependencies.
Note that if you want to use GPU acceleration, then you will need to do whatever is required to allow `torch` and `llama-cpp` to access your GPU too.

There are sometimes difficulties configuring Rust during the pip installs.
If you encounter such issues, then one work around (if you use Anaconda) is to create your environment along the lines of
```bash
conda create -n guidance-312 python=3.12 rust
```
In our experience, this has been a little more reliable.
Similarly, to get GPU support, we have found that (after activating the environment) running
```bash
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
works best.
However, if you have your own means of installing Rust and CUDA, you should be able to continue using those.

## Running Tests

Because we run tests on GPU-equipped machines and also tests which call LLM endpoints, approval is required before our GitHub workflows will run on external Pull Requests.
To run a basic test suite locally, we suggest:
```bash
python -m pytest -m "not (needs_credentials or use_gpu or server)" ./tests/
```
which runs our basic test suite.
Where an LLM is required, this will default to using GPT2 on the CPU.
To change that default, run
```bash
python -m pytest -m "not (needs_credentials or use_gpu or server)" --selected_model <MODELNAME> ./tests/
```
where `<MODELNAME>` is taken from the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` dictionary defined in `conftest.py`.

## Adding LLMs to the test matrix

Our tests run on a variety of LLMs.
These fall into three categories: CPU-based, GPU-based and endpoint-based (which need credentials).

### New CPU or GPU-based models

Due to the limited resources of the regular GitHub runner machines, the LLM under test is a dimension of our test matrix (otherwise the GitHub runners will tend to run out of RAM and/or hard drive space).
New models should be configured in the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` dictionary in `conftest.py`, and then that key added to the `model` list in `unit_tests.yml` or `unit_tests_gpu.yml` as appropriate.
The model will then be available via the `selected_model` fixture for all tests.
If you have a test which should only run for particular models, you can use the `selected_model_name` fixture to check, and call `pytest.skip()` if necessary.
An example of this is given in `test_llama_cpp.py`.

### New endpoint based models

If your model requires credentials, then those will need to be added to our GitHub repository as secrets.
The endpoint itself (and any other required information) should be configured as environment variables too.
When the test runs, the environment variables will be set, and can then be used to configure the model as required.
See `test_azureai_openai.py` for examples of this being done.
The tests should also be marked as `needs_credentials` - if this is needed for the entire module, then `pytestmark` can be used - see `test_azureai_openai.py` again for this.

The environment variables and secrets will also need to be configured in the `ci_tests.yml` file.

## Linting

We run `black` on our codebase, and plan to turn on enforcement of this in the GitHub workflows soon.
