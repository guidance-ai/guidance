Installation
============


The simplest way to install stitch is via pip::

    pip install stitch

or via conda::

    conda install stitch


If you installed via pip, and notebook version < 5.3, you will also have to
install / configure the front-end extension as well. If you are using classic
notebook (as opposed to Jupyterlab), run::

    jupyter nbextension install [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py stitch

    jupyter nbextension enable [--sys-prefix / --user / --system] --py stitch

with the `appropriate flag`_. If you are using Jupyterlab, install the extension
with::

    jupyter labextension install stitch

If you are installing using conda, these commands should be unnecessary, but If
you need to run them the commands should be the same (just make sure you choose the
`--sys-prefix` flag).
